# What is an endpoint in networking?
An endpoint refers to any device that establishes a connection with a computer network. Consider the scenario where Bob and Alice engage in a phone conversation. In this case, their connection spans from one individual to the other, and the "endpoints" of their communication are their respective phones. Similarly, within a network, computerized devices engage in "conversations" by exchanging information. Just as Bob represents one endpoint in his conversation with Alice, a computer that is connected to a network serves as an endpoint for an ongoing data exchange.

Examples of everyday endpoints encompass a range of devices such as desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

# What is not an endpoint?
Customer premise equipment (CPE), rather than endpoints, encompasses the infrastructure devices that support the network. CPE includes:

* Routers
* Switches
* Network gateways
* Firewalls
* Load balancers

To illustrate this further, let's consider the example of Bob and Alice having a conversation over the phone. The cell tower facilitating their communication is not an endpoint for their data exchange; instead, it serves as the medium through which their exchange occurs.

Another example can be a grocery store equipped with various devices. The store's network incorporates several cash registers running point-of-sale (POS) software, a router connecting the network to the Internet, an internal server storing daily transaction records, and employees who connect their personal smartphones to the store's WiFi. In this scenario, the router is categorized as CPE. Conversely, the other devices, including personal smartphones not directly managed by the store, are considered endpoints on the store's network.

# Why do attackers target endpoints?
Attackers consistently make efforts to seize control of or breach endpoint devices. Their motivations can vary, ranging from infecting the device with malware and monitoring user activity to holding the device for ransom, utilizing it as part of a botnet, leveraging it as a launchpad to compromise other devices within the network, and more.

In the realm of business, attackers often focus on endpoints due to their potential to serve as entry points into an otherwise secure corporate network. While an attacker may face difficulties breaching the corporate firewall, an employee's laptop, for instance, could present a comparatively easier target.

Securing endpoints in a business environment poses challenges as IT teams have limited access to these devices compared to the internal networking infrastructure. Additionally, endpoint devices exhibit significant variations in terms of their make, model, operating system, installed applications, and security readiness. Measures that effectively safeguard smartphones from attacks may not prove effective for servers, for example. Furthermore, while one employee diligently updates their laptop and avoids risky online behaviors, another employee might neglect software updates and engage in unsafe downloading practices. Consequently, the company must find a way to protect both laptops from attacks and prevent them from compromising the network.

Given the complexity of securing endpoints and their criticality, endpoint security has emerged as a distinct category within the realm of cybersecurity. It stands alongside network security, cloud security, web application security, IoT security, access control, and other domains. The market currently offers a wide array of security products specifically designed for endpoint protection.

# What is endpoint management?
Endpoint management involves the continuous monitoring of network-connected endpoints, with a focus on allowing access only to authenticated endpoints, fortifying their security, and overseeing the software installed on them, including non-security applications. Endpoint management software can be either centralized or installed on each device separately, serving the purpose of enforcing security measures and authorization policies.

# What about API endpoints?
An "API endpoint" refers to a concept that shares similarities but has a slightly nuanced meaning. In the context of software development, an API endpoint represents the server-side of a connection established between an application programming interface (API) and a client. For example, imagine a website that incorporates a cartography API to offer driving directions. In this scenario, the website server functions as the API client, while the cartography API server operates as the API endpoint.
