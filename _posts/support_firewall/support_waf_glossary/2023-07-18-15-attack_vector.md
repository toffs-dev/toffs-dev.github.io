# What is an attack vector?

An attack vector, also known as a threat vector, refers to the avenues through which attackers can infiltrate a network or system. Various attack vectors include social engineering tactics, stealing credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities, and inadequate protection against insider threats. In the realm of information security, it is crucial to minimize or eliminate attack vectors whenever feasible.

Consider a scenario where a security firm is responsible for safeguarding a valuable painting displayed in a museum. Numerous entry and exit points exist, including front and back doors, elevators, and windows. A potential thief might even attempt to gain access by impersonating a museum staff member. Each of these methods represents an attack vector, and the security firm's objective would be to mitigate them by deploying security guards at all entrances, securing windows with locks, and regularly verifying the identities of museum personnel.

Similarly, digital systems possess vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit as entry points. Due to the inherent complexity of modern computing systems and application environments, it is often impractical to completely close off all attack vectors. Nonetheless, implementing robust security practices and safeguards can effectively minimize most attack vectors, significantly raising the difficulty level for potential attackers seeking to exploit them.

# What are some of the most common attack vectors?
* Phishing: Phishing is a method used by attackers to steal sensitive data, such as passwords, in order to gain unauthorized access to a network. This is achieved by deceiving the victim into divulging their information. Phishing attacks are widely utilized and often serve as the initial step in ransomware campaigns against targeted organizations.

* Email attachments: Email attachments are a commonly exploited avenue for attacks. They can contain malicious code that executes when a user opens the file. Notably, numerous significant ransomware attacks, including Ryuk attacks, have leveraged this method.

* Account takeover: Attackers employ various techniques to take control of legitimate user accounts. These can involve stealing a user's credentials through phishing or brute force attacks, or purchasing them from illicit sources. Intercepting and utilizing a session cookie to impersonate a user within a web application is also a potential strategy.

* Lack of encryption: Unencrypted data is susceptible to unauthorized viewing by individuals who have access to it. It can be intercepted during transit, such as in an on-path attack, or inadvertently viewed by intermediaries along the network route.

* Insider threats: Insider threats occur when known and trusted users access and distribute confidential data or enable attackers to do the same. These threats can be intentional or accidental on the part of the user. External attackers may attempt to exploit insiders by directly contacting them and using methods like asking, bribing, tricking, or threatening to gain access. Additionally, malicious insiders may act independently, driven by dissatisfaction or other motives.

* Vulnerability exploits: Vulnerabilities refer to flaws in software or hardware that can be likened to malfunctioning locks, allowing knowledgeable individuals to breach secured systems. When attackers successfully leverage vulnerabilities to gain entry, it is known as a vulnerability "exploit." Most vulnerabilities can be remedied by applying updates from the software or hardware vendor. However, some vulnerabilities, called "zero-day" vulnerabilities, are unknown and lack a known fix.

* Browser-based attacks: Internet browsers load and execute code received from remote servers to display webpages. Attackers can inject malicious code into websites or redirect users to fraudulent websites, tricking browsers into executing code that downloads malware or compromises user devices. This threat vector is particularly concerning in cloud computing environments where employees predominantly access data and applications through their browsers.

* Application compromise: Instead of directly targeting user accounts, attackers may infect trusted third-party applications with malware. Alternatively, they may create fake, malicious applications that users unknowingly download and install. This method is prevalent in attacks targeting mobile devices.

* Open ports: Ports serve as virtual gateways into devices, facilitating the association of network traffic with specific applications or processes. Unused ports should be closed. Attackers can send carefully crafted messages to open ports, attempting to compromise the system by exploiting any unlocked "doors," similar to how a car thief checks for unlocked doors.

# How can an organization secure its attack vectors?
There is no foolproof way to completely eliminate attack vectors. However, employing the following strategies can effectively mitigate both internal and external attacks:

* Implementing strong security practices: Many successful attacks result from user errors such as falling for phishing attempts, opening malicious email attachments, or granting unauthorized access. Educating users to avoid these mistakes can significantly reduce several major attack vectors.

* Employing encryption: Encrypting data during transit prevents it from being exposed to unauthorized parties that may intercept it.

* Utilizing browser isolation: This technology relocates the loading and execution of untrusted code to a separate location outside an organization's secure network. Browser isolation can help mitigate the risk of zero-day attacks, particularly within the browser environment.

* Regularly patching vulnerabilities: A significant number of attacks occur when organizations fail to patch known vulnerabilities. By promptly addressing vulnerabilities and keeping software and hardware up to date, the likelihood of successful vulnerability exploits can be greatly reduced.

* Adopting a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) approach: As the reliance on cloud computing continues to reshape corporate computing models, organizations often need to adjust their networking and security strategies accordingly. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) offers a method for integrating networking and security. It encompasses several security measures that effectively close off the aforementioned attack vectors. For more information on SASE, please refer to additional resources.

Remember, while these approaches can significantly enhance security, maintaining vigilance and regularly reassessing security measures is crucial in an ever-evolving threat landscape.

# What is an attack surface?
An attack surface refers to the collective range of attack vectors that an attacker can exploit. The size of the attack surface increases with the number of available attack vectors. Conversely, organizations can decrease their attack surface by minimizing or eliminating attack vectors whenever feasible.

Imagine an attacker as an offensive player in a game of association football (soccer), and the attack surface as the goal. In the absence of a goalkeeper, the front of the goal presents a relatively large area for the player to kick the ball through. However, when a goalkeeper strategically positions themselves and defenders support them, the available space for the offense is reduced.

Similarly, all organizations possess a "goal" that external attackers aim forâ€”the attack surface and the sensitive data it guards. However, security products and practices act as the goalkeeper and defenders, obstructing attackers from exploiting those attack vectors.
