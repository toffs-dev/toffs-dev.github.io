# How to improve WordPress security
Content management systems (CMS) are software applications that enable users to create, manage, and customize websites without the need for coding expertise. WordPress stands out as one of the most widely used CMS globally, making it an attractive target for cyber attackers.

To safeguard WordPress websites, the platform's internal teams regularly release security updates and patches to address newly discovered vulnerabilities. However, WordPress users can also take proactive measures to ensure the security of their sites against both known and emerging threats. These measures can be broadly categorized as threat elimination and risk reduction.

Threat elimination involves strategies aimed at eliminating cyber attacks and other potential threats. For instance, users can implement a firewall to filter out malicious traffic, thereby mitigating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Additionally, opting for a hosting provider that offers built-in security features can enhance protection.

Risk reduction encompasses proactive security practices that minimize the likelihood of successful attacks. Examples include changing the default WordPress database prefix to make it harder for attackers to locate, enforcing stringent user access requirements, and regularly conducting security scans to identify and address vulnerabilities.

# How secure is WordPress?
Although WordPress is a robust and versatile platform, it remains susceptible to cyber attacks, vulnerabilities, and other risks that can be introduced due to user error.

**Common WordPress attacks**
- Instances of password-based attacks involve the use of brute force techniques where attackers repeatedly input various combinations of user credentials (comprising usernames and passwords) into a login page. This method is frequently employed to gain unauthorized access to a WordPress account. Additionally, attackers may utilize credential stuffing and dictionary attacks as alternative forms of password-based assaults.

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is another type of attack that allows malicious code to be injected into a WordPress site, often executed through the utilization of WordPress plugins.

- SQL injection (SQLi), sometimes referred to as database injection, involves injecting malicious code into a WordPress site via data entry fields such as contact forms.

- DDoS attacks are designed to inundate WordPress websites with an excessive influx of unwanted traffic, leading to severe degradation in performance or complete disruption of services.

**WordPress vulnerabilities**

- Updated versions of WordPress: WordPress consistently releases updates for their core software to address known vulnerabilities and enhance their defenses against new threats. Using older versions of WordPress exposes your site to potential attacks as they lack these security patches.

- Third-party themes and plugins: While third-party WordPress themes and plugins offer a wide range of functionalities, they may not always adhere to the latest security standards. Installing such themes and plugins on your WordPress site can introduce security risks.

- Presence of backdoors: When an attacker gains unauthorized access to a WordPress account, they can create a backdoor, which is a hidden method to bypass security measures. Backdoors enable attackers to maintain persistent access to your WordPress site or carry out additional attacks.

- Weak user authentication: Neglecting proper password hygiene, such as creating strong passwords and regularly changing them, or failing to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), increases the chances of a security breach.

- Default WordPress settings: WordPress comes with default settings that can make it easier for attackers to identify common entry points, like the /wp-login.php URL, or gain access to sensitive site information, such as the wp-config.php file. It is important to modify these default settings to enhance your site's security.

# WordPress security best practices
To safeguard WordPress websites against prevalent cyber threats and known vulnerabilities, users can implement a series of measures. These measures can be broadly categorized as follows: website configuration, proactive security functionalities, user authentication, user privileges, and regular site security updates.

**Secure site setup**
- Ensure secure WordPress hosting: The security of your WordPress website heavily relies on your hosting provider. Choose a host that offers robust protection against advanced attacks, conducts regular scans for emerging vulnerabilities and threats, and provides resources for disaster recovery.

- Modify the default WordPress login page URL and database prefix: By default, WordPress sites have URLs ending in /wp-login.php and /wp-admin, which are easily identifiable by attackers. Rename these URLs to deter brute force attacks and other targeted threats.

- Relocate the wp-config.php file: The wp-config.php file contains sensitive information, including WordPress security keys and installation details. Unfortunately, it is often easy for attackers to find. Enhance security by moving the file above the WordPress root directory, making it harder for attackers to locate.

- Install a secure WordPress theme: Some WordPress themes may lack support for the latest WordPress version or fail to meet existing security standards. This makes them susceptible to exploitation by attackers. Choose a theme available in the official WordPress theme directory or validate it using a WordPress theme validator before installation.

- Conceal the WordPress version in use: Many WordPress attacks exploit vulnerabilities specific to certain versions. By hiding the version of WordPress you're using, you can reduce the risk of these threats or make it more challenging for attackers to identify weaknesses in your site.

**Install proactive security features**

- Utilize an SSL/TLS certificate: Secure Socket Layer (SSL), also referred to as Transport Layer Security (TLS), is a security protocol that enhances data security and encryption when transmitting information over the internet. SSL certificates can be obtained from hosting providers or third-party security services like Toffs.

- Implement a firewall: A web application firewall (WAF) serves as a protective layer for WordPress sites by filtering and blocking unauthorized traffic. Installing a WAF can effectively mitigate the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ensuring uninterrupted site service.

- Disable HTTP requests utilizing the XML-RPC protocol: XML-RPC is often exploited for volumetric cyber attacks or brute force attempts. By utilizing a plugin or configuring firewall rules, it is possible to disable the XML-RPC feature, thus minimizing the risk associated with these types of attacks.

- Prevent hotlinking: Hotlinking permits third parties to embed content from WordPress sites without hosting it themselves. When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to increased bandwidth costs for the original content host. Implement measures to prevent hotlinking and protect your website's resources and bandwidth.

**Secure user access**

- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional identification before gaining access to a protected system or account. This measure significantly increases the difficulty for attackers to infiltrate a WordPress site, even if they manage to crack a legitimate user's username and password combination.

- Set a limit on failed login attempts. By restricting the number of unsuccessful login tries on a login page, the likelihood of password attacks being successful decreases. Attackers are less likely to gain unauthorized access when they have a limited number of attempts to input credentials.

- Enable automatic logout for inactive users. Certain users may access their WordPress accounts from public computers or engage in unsafe browsing practices. To mitigate the risks of unauthorized access and eavesdropping, automatically log out users after a designated period of inactivity. This proactive approach reduces the chances of snooping and other unauthorized third-party activities.

- Remove inactive user accounts. Even if a user is no longer actively utilizing their account to access a WordPress site, their account and login credentials can still become targets for attackers. It is advisable to delete inactive user accounts to prevent any potential security breaches.

**Manage user permissions**

- Enforce strict file and folder permissions: Avoid granting users admin-level privileges unless absolutely necessary. By limiting user permissions, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Adhering to the principle of least privilege is crucial. To learn more about this principle, refer to relevant resources.

- Disable file editing: By default, WordPress provides a file editor that allows users to modify PHP files directly. However, in the event of a WordPress account breach, this feature can be exploited by attackers to make significant changes to your site's code. It is recommended to disable the file editing functionality to mitigate this risk.

- Monitor user activity: Cyberattacks on WordPress sites can originate from external or internal sources. Regularly monitoring and logging user activity enables you to detect any suspicious behavior promptly. Keep an eye out for activities such as unauthorized plugin installations, file alterations, or any other actions that deviate from expected user behavior. Reviewing these logs will help you identify potential security threats and take appropriate action.

**Update WordPress security features**

- Ensure you have the latest version of WordPress installed. WordPress is frequently updated to protect against known vulnerabilities. Keep an eye out for the notification on the top of the WordPress dashboard, indicating a new version is available.

- Keep your WordPress themes and plugins up to date. Every theme and plugin can serve as a potential entry point for attackers. Similar to outdated versions of WordPress, attackers often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated themes and plugins to target WordPress users.

- Perform regular security scans. Utilize a trusted security plugin, software, or third-party service to automatically scan for malware and other security risks.

- Regularly create backups of your website's data. In the unfortunate event of a successful attack, having recent backups allows you to restore any lost data easily.
