# What is a zero-day exploit?
A zero-day exploit, also known as a zero-day threat, refers to an assault that exploits a security vulnerability for which no remedy currently exists. The term "zero-day" is used because once the flaw is uncovered, the developer or organization has no time left to devise a solution.
What is a vulnerability?

# What is a vulnerability?
A vulnerability refers to an unintended flaw in software or hardware that arises from programming errors or incorrect configurations. Due to their unintentional nature, vulnerabilities pose challenges in detection and can remain undetected for extended periods, ranging from days and months to even years.

# How do zero-day exploits work?
When cyber attackers discover a previously undisclosed vulnerability, they develop specialized code designed to exploit that specific weakness and incorporate it into malicious software. Upon execution, this code can compromise the security of a system.

There are diverse methods employed by attackers to take advantage of zero-day vulnerabilities. One prevalent strategy involves disseminating malware through phishing emails containing attachments or links that are embedded with the exploits. When a user interacts with these attachments or links, the malicious payloads are activated.

An infamous incident involving a zero-day attack occurred in 2014, targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment. During this attack, sensitive information, including unreleased movies, internal email communications, and business plans, was made public. The attackers leveraged a zero-day exploit to gain access to this data.

Zero-day exploits can have significant detrimental effects on a business. Apart from the loss of valuable or confidential data, customers may lose trust in the organization, leading to reputational damage. Additionally, addressing the vulnerability often requires diverting crucial engineering resources to develop and implement patches for the flaw.

# How to detect zero-day threats
Zero-day threats are inherently challenging to detect. Several strategies have been devised to enhance detection capabilities:

* Statistics-based detection: Employing machine learning, historical data from past exploits is gathered to establish a baseline of safe behavior. This enables real-time detection of zero-day threats. However, this approach lacks adaptability to changing patterns, necessitating the construction of new attack profiles to accommodate such variations.

* Signature-based detection: This method has been employed in security monitoring for quite some time. It involves cross-referencing local files and downloads with existing databases of malware signatures, which are unique values indicating the presence of malicious code. A limitation of this approach is that it can only identify threats that are already known, rendering it ineffective against most zero-day threats.

* Behavior-based detection: This technique analyzes user interactions with established software to identify potentially malicious activities. Behavior-based detection focuses on learning expected future behavior and endeavors to block any anomalous behavior. It relies on the prediction of network traffic patterns.

These strategies aim to facilitate the detection of zero-day threats, each with its own advantages and limitations.

# How to prevent zero-day attacks
Minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities in code cannot be achieved by a single approach alone. However, there are various tactics and tools that can be employed to mitigate their impact. Among these, browser isolation and firewalls play a vital role in preventing vulnerability exploits.

* Browser Isolation:
When engaging in browsing activities such as opening email attachments or completing online forms, there is a risk of interacting with code from untrusted sources, which can be exploited by attackers. Browser isolation ensures a separation between browsing activity and end user devices as well as corporate networks, thereby preventing potentially malicious code from running on the user's device. Browser isolation can be implemented in three different ways:

1. Remote Browser Isolation: Webpages are loaded, and code execution takes place on a cloud server, which is independent of users' devices and internal networks of organizations.

2. On-Premise Browser Isolation: This approach is similar to remote browser isolation, but it occurs on a server managed internally within the organization.

3. Client-Side Browser Isolation: Webpages are still loaded on the user's device, but sandboxing, a security mechanism that keeps programs running in isolation, ensures that the content and code remain separate from the rest of the device's environment.

* Firewall:
A firewall acts as a security system that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security policies. Positioned between trusted and untrusted networks, typically the Internet, firewalls safeguard against threats by blocking malicious content from reaching trusted networks and preventing sensitive information from leaving the network. Firewalls can be implemented through hardware, software, or a combination of both. By scrutinizing network traffic, a firewall can obstruct traffic that targets security vulnerabilities, thereby thwarting zero-day exploits.

# How does Toffs protect against zero-day vulnerabilities?
Toffs offers a remote browser isolation solution that ensures enhanced security for users. By utilizing sandboxing techniques, this solution conducts users' browsing activities within a supervised cloud environment. This isolation effectively shields users' end devices from potential vulnerabilities, including zero-day threats.

To safeguard web applications from malicious HTTP traffic, Toffs provides a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Recognizing the difficulty in detecting zero-day threats and the ever-evolving nature of the security landscape, Toffs incorporates a Managed Ruleset that offers robust protection against these vulnerabilities. The Managed Rulesets are consistently updated by Toffs to ensure ongoing and up-to-date security measures.
