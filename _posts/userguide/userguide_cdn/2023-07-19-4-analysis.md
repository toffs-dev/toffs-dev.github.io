### Realtime Report

#### Traffic Report

Figure 03

This page is the **“Traffic Report”** page under the **“Realtime Report” **page

This page allows you to monitor the **TOTAL TRAFFIC** for your selected domain using an interactive graph. You can view traffic data for different time intervals, such as an hour, a day, a week, a month, or customize your preferred timeframe.

You have the flexibility to choose the desired time period and explore the total traffic for your domain. The graph presents the following breakdown:

1. The blue portion represents the **TOTAL** traffic for the specific hour, day, week, month, or custom timeframe of the domain.

2. The yellow portion indicates the total **UNCACHED** traffic during the specified hour, day, week, month, or custom timeframe of the domain.

3. The red portion represents the total **CACHED** traffic for the given hour, day, week, month, or custom timeframe of the domain.


#### Cache Hit Radio

Figure 04

The **"Cache Hit Radio"** page is an integral part of the broader **"Realtime Report"** section, designed to provide you with real-time analytics regarding your domain's caching performance. Within this dedicated page, you can access crucial data pertaining to the percentage of Cache Hits your domain experiences within specific time intervals or on particular dates.

Understanding the significance of Cache Hits is essential for optimizing your website's performance. A Cache Hit occurs when a user's request matches content that is already stored in the cache, resulting in faster loading times and reduced server load. Therefore, a higher Cache Hit percentage indicates a more effective caching mechanism, leading to improved user experiences and website responsiveness.

**Maximum Cache Hit Percentage:**
This metric represents the highest percentage of Cache Hits recorded during the selected timeframe. Knowing the peak Cache Hit rate helps you identify the most successful periods of caching performance and allows you to replicate and maintain those favorable conditions.

**Average Cache Hit Percentage:**
The average Cache Hit percentage, on the other hand, provides a broader overview of caching efficiency over the specified time or date range. It factors in variations and fluctuations, giving you a more comprehensive understanding of how well your caching strategy performs on average.

By analyzing these two essential metrics, you can make informed decisions to optimize your caching configuration, leading to enhanced website speed, reduced server load, and ultimately, a better user experience for your visitors.


#### Request Report

Figure 05

This is the **“Request Report”** page under the **“Realtime Report”** page.

On this page, you have the ability to track the overall number of requests for your selected domain using an easily interpretable graph. The graph can display data for an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a custom time range.

You have the flexibility to choose both the time period and the specific domain you want to analyze. The graph is color-coded for better understanding:

1. The blue section represents the **TOTAL** number of requests for the chosen hour, day, week, month, or custom time range for the selected domain.
2. The yellow section corresponds to the total number of requests that were **UN-CACHED** during the chosen hour, day, week, month, or custom time range for the selected domain.
3. The red section indicates the total number of requests that were **CACHED** during the chosen hour, day, week, month, or custom time range for the selected domain.

This graphical representation allows for a quick and comprehensive view of your domain's request activities, enabling you to make informed decisions based on the provided data.


#### HTTP Status Code

Figure

The **"HTTP Status Code**" page within the **"Realtime Report"** offers valuable insights into the world of HTTP status codes, assisting in the identification and resolution of issues related to web page loading and resource accessibility.

**HTTP status codes** serve as standardized response codes used by web servers to communicate with web browsers and clients. When you access a webpage or resource on the internet, the server will respond with a specific status code, indicating the outcome of the request. Each status code carries a particular meaning, helping developers and users to comprehend the situation at hand.

By understanding the specific HTTP status codes received, developers and website administrators can pinpoint the issue and take appropriate actions to rectify it. On this page, you have the flexibility to choose the desired period of time and view status codes specific to a particular domain. This real-time report empowers you to analyze website performance, troubleshoot errors, and enhance overall user experience.

The period of time can be chosen along with **Status Codes** of the domain you wish to view.


#### URI Report

Figure 07

This is the **“URI Report”** page under the **“Realtime Report”** page.	

**URI** stands for **Uniform Resource Identifier**. Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which play a pivotal role in facilitating resource access across computer networks and the World Wide Web. The primary purpose of URIs is to establish a standardized method for other computers to retrieve resources.

Here, users have the flexibility to select a specific time period and domain of interest for analysis. Once the preferences are set, the corresponding URI reports will be generated and displayed below, providing valuable insights into resource utilization and accessibility.

#### Requests by Country

Figure 08

This is the **“Remote Address”** page under the **“Realtime Report”** page.

The **"Remote Address"** page provides essential information about the IP Address/hostname of the remote computer to which the connection is currently established. It serves as a valuable tool to monitor and analyze the connections to different remote systems.

1. To tailor your analysis, you have the flexibility to select a specific period of time for which you want to view the data. Additionally, you can choose the domain you wish to focus on by adjusting the **"Value"** and **"Count"** parameters.

2. Upon selecting your preferred time frame and domain criteria, the data pertaining to the Remote Address will be displayed in the form of a comprehensive report. The information will be presented in the two columns designated as **"Value"** and **"Count"**, providing you with a clear overview of the connection statistics for the chosen domain. This enables you to make informed decisions and gain insights into the network's remote connections.
