### Traffic Report

![800](/public/assets/images/userguide/cdn/143.png)

*Figure 143*


This page is the **“Traffic Report”** page under the **“Realtime Report”** page

This page allows you to monitor the **TOTAL TRAFFIC** for your selected domain using an interactive graph. You can view traffic data for different time intervals, such as an hour, a day, a week, a month, or customize your preferred timeframe.

You have the flexibility to choose the desired time period and explore the total traffic for your domain. The graph presents the following breakdown:

1. The blue portion represents the **TOTAL** traffic for the specific hour, day, week, month, or custom timeframe of the domain.
2. The yellow portion indicates the total **UNCACHED** traffic during the specified hour, day, week, month, or custom timeframe of the domain.
3. The red portion represents the total **CACHE**D traffic for the given hour, day, week, month, or custom timeframe of the domain.

### Bandwidth

![800](/public/assets/images/userguide/cdn/144.png)

*Figure 144*

This page is the **“Bandwidth Report”**, which provides crucial insights into your content delivery network's data usage. The report showcases the bandwidth consumption in Bytes per second (Bytes/s) and offers a comprehensive breakdown of time intervals, including Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Custom Time ranges.

Once you have chosen your desired timeframe, the Bandwidth Report will present your data in a user-friendly graphical format. You will typically see a line graph or bar chart that displays the bandwidth usage over time. The x-axis represents the time period (e.g., hours, days, weeks, or months), while the y-axis shows the corresponding bandwidth usage in Bytes/s.

Use the report's insights to:

- Identify usage patterns: Spot peak traffic hours or days, allowing you to allocate resources effectively.
- Monitor growth trends: Track your CDN's performance over time and ensure it aligns with your content delivery goals.
- Optimize CDN performance: Identify any anomalies or irregularities, allowing you to address potential issues promptly.


### Cache Hit Radio 

![800](/public/assets/images/userguide/cdn/145.png)

*Figure 145*

The **"Cache Hit Radio"** page is an integral part of the broader **"Realtime Report"** section, designed to provide you with real-time analytics regarding your domain's caching performance. Within this dedicated page, you can access crucial data pertaining to the percentage of Cache Hits your domain experiences within specific time intervals or on particular dates.

Understanding the significance of Cache Hits is essential for optimizing your website's performance. A Cache Hit occurs when a user's request matches content that is already stored in the cache, resulting in faster loading times and reduced server load. Therefore, a higher Cache Hit percentage indicates a more effective caching mechanism, leading to improved user experiences and website responsiveness.

**Maximum Cache Hit Percentage:**
This metric represents the highest percentage of Cache Hits recorded during the selected timeframe. Knowing the peak Cache Hit rate helps you identify the most successful periods of caching performance and allows you to replicate and maintain those favorable conditions.

**Average Cache Hit Percentage:**
The average Cache Hit percentage, on the other hand, provides a broader overview of caching efficiency over the specified time or date range. It factors in variations and fluctuations, giving you a more comprehensive understanding of how well your caching strategy performs on average.

By analyzing these two essential metrics, you can make informed decisions to optimize your caching configuration, leading to enhanced website speed, reduced server load, and ultimately, a better user experience for your visitors.


### Request Report 

![800](/public/assets/images/userguide/cdn/146.png)

*Figure 146*

This is the **“Request Report”** page under the **“Realtime Report”** page.
On this page, you have the ability to track the overall number of requests for your selected domain using an easily interpretable graph. The graph can display data for an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a custom time range.

You have the flexibility to choose both the time period and the specific domain you want to analyze. The graph is color-coded for better understanding:

1. The blue section represents the **TOTAL** number of requests for the chosen hour, day, week, month, or custom time range for the selected domain.
2. The yellow section corresponds to the total number of requests that were **UN-CACHED** during the chosen hour, day, week, month, or custom time range for the selected domain.
3. The red section indicates the total number of requests that were **CACHED** during the chosen hour, day, week, month, or custom time range for the selected domain.

This graphical representation allows for a quick and comprehensive view of your domain's request activities, enabling you to make informed decisions based on the provided data.


### HTTP Status Code

![800](/public/assets/images/userguide/cdn/147.png)

*Figure 147*

The **"HTTP Status Code"** page within the **"Realtime Report"** offers valuable insights into the world of HTTP status codes, assisting in the identification and resolution of issues related to web page loading and resource accessibility.

**HTTP status codes** serve as standardized response codes used by web servers to communicate with web browsers and clients. When you access a webpage or resource on the internet, the server will respond with a specific status code, indicating the outcome of the request. Each status code carries a particular meaning, helping developers and users to comprehend the situation at hand.

By understanding the specific HTTP status codes received, developers and website administrators can pinpoint the issue and take appropriate actions to rectify it. On this page, you have the flexibility to choose the desired period of time and view status codes specific to a particular domain. This real-time report empowers you to analyze website performance, troubleshoot errors, and enhance overall user experience.

The period of time can be chosen along with **Status Codes** of the domain you wish to view.
