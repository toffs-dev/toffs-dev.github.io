This is the **“Overview”** page for your account where you have full control over and access to the domains you've added. Here are some key metrics you'll find here:

- **Total Domains:** This indicates the overall number of domains currently added to your account.
- **Total Users:** You can see the number of users who are sharing this account.
- **Total Customers:** This represents the count of customers utilizing the system.

In addition to these metrics, we provide a convenient filter function that enables you to view **"Traffic Data"** and **"List Domain Be Attacked"** for different domains based on hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly intervals. This allows you to analyze data and identify patterns more efficiently.

Please contact **Toffs Security Operation Center** for assistance if you encounter any issues.
