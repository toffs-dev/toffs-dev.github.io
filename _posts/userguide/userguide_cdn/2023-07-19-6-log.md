This is the **“Audit Log”** page. 

The **"Audit Log"** page serves as a comprehensive record of all past user actions associated with the account. Users can conveniently search for specific events based on the following criteria: Action, Type, and User.

The log is organized into four key sections:

- **Action:** This section displays the specific action that was executed by the user.
- **Action Type:** Here, the action is categorized under its respective type for better organization and understanding.
- **Performed by User:** This part indicates the user responsible for carrying out the particular action.
- **Created At:** The exact date and time of the action's occurrence are shown in this section.


By utilizing these categorizations, users can easily review and analyze their historical account activities in a streamlined manner.
