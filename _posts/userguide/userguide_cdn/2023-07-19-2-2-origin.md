**“Round Robin”**, **“Backup”**, **“IP Hash”** or **“Least Connected”** mode:

- **IP Hash:** The system will rely on the Client’s IP to coordinate and maintain the connection down to the Server Origin. 

- **Backup:** The servers with this parameter will only receive requests from the load balancer once all other servers are down.

- **Round Robin:** The system will automatically distribute traffic down to the Client’s Server Origin with a rotation method - evenly between the servers.

- **Least Connected:** The system will choose the Server Origin with the lowest amount of connections to coordinate downlink traffic.


### Origin White List

An IP whitelist filters user requests, and blocks or allows requests from specified IP addresses. The IP list feature can protect TOFFS CDN points of presence (POPs) from IP theft and attacks. 

**Whitelist:** Only requests from IP addresses on the whitelist can access resources on the POPs. By default, the IP list feature is disabled. 

Configuration example:
- Whitelist
- CIDR block: 192.168.2.0/24

**Expected result:** Only IP addresses that range from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.254 can access the resources of the specified domain name.

To configure the Origin White List, complete the following steps:
