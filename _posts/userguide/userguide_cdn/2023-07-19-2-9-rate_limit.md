This is the **“Rate Limit”** page under the **“Configuration”** page.

Enter a descriptive name for the rule in Rule name.

Under **When incoming requests match**, use the **Field** drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for Field is compared to the value you specify for **Value** using the operator selected in **Operator**.

Under **Then** section, enter the value of the below parameter:

- **Memory Size:** The number of memory sizes that the system will store.
- **Rate Limit:** The number of requests in a second.
- **Burst:** The number of requests that will wait to continue to handle.

To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

When the requests to the domain meet the Rate Limit rule, the system will show the response code 429.
