### Basic WAF Rules

Figure 64

Basic WAF Rules: A web application firewall (WAF) is a firewall that monitors, filters and blocks data packets as they travel to and from a website or web application. WAFs protect servers. A WAF is deployed to protect a specific web application or sets of web applications. It applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation.

“Search” function makes searching for the rules that you have implemented easier.

“+Add” function allows you to add rules to protect your domain.
