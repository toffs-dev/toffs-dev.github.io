The **Setting** function is an essential part of the CDN (Content Delivery Network) modules used by the **TOFFS Technologies Support Team**. This function provides configuration options for managing the **Global WAF (Web Application Firewall) Rule, Binding IP, Server, and Zone** settings. By properly utilizing the Setting function, the support team can enhance the performance, security, and efficiency of the CDN services offered to clients.

**Global WAF Rules** are a critical part of web security. They protect your web applications from various threats, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common attack vectors. Within the "Setting" function, you can define and manage Global WAF Rules to customize security policies for your CDN-enabled websites.

**Binding IP** is a crucial aspect of CDN management, especially when you want to restrict access to your CDN services from specific IP addresses or IP ranges. The "Setting" function allows you to configure IP binding to enhance security and control access to your content.

The "Setting" function also provides options to manage **Server** within the CDN infrastructure. Here, you can add or remove servers (Master or Slave), modify server settings, and ensure that your CDN is optimally utilizing server resources for content delivery.

**Zone** define the geographical regions where your CDN delivers content. Properly configuring zones ensures that your content is cached closer to end-users, reducing latency and enhancing website performance.


## Global WAF Rule

![800](/public/assets/images/userguide/cdn/188.png)

*Figure 188*

This is the **“Global WAF Rule”** page used for **Toffs Technologies Support Team**. 

This page serves as a platform for the **Toffs Technologies Support Team** to create **Global rules** that are evaluated for every request passing through the WAF. These rules hold a higher priority compared to the rest of the rules present in the managed rule sets. Each **Global WAF Rule** consists of a rule name, rule priority, and an array of matching conditions.

The **"Search"** function facilitates the supporter in locating the implemented Global WAF rules more efficiently.

Furthermore, the **"+Add**" function empowers the supporter to include Global WAF rules to safeguard the domains of all customers.

**Here's how the Global WAF Rule flow works:**

**Adding a new rule:**
- In the **Global section**, the rule will be added to the **Global WAF Rule page**, with its default status set to OFF.
- In the **Local section**, the same rule will also be added to the **Custom WAF Rules page**, with its default status set to **OFF** and **Global Type**.

**Removing an existing rule:**
- In the **Global section**, the rule will be removed from the **Global WAF Rule** page.
- In the **Local section**, the rule will also be removed from the **Custom WAF Rules** page.

**To utilize the Global WAF Rule effectively:**

- The supporter can enable or disable this rule on both the Global WAF Rule page and the Custom WAF Rules page for each customer's domain.

- On the other hand, customers can only enable or disable this rule on their respective Custom WAF Rules page for their domains.

It is essential to note that the system enforces WAF rules based on priority levels: Global WAF Rule takes precedence over Custom WAF Rule, which in turn takes precedence over Basic WAF Rule. This hierarchy ensures effective rule management and security for the Toffs Technologies Support Team and their customers.

- **Edit:** Use this action to modify the existing details of the zone, such as its Name, Description, or Status.
- **Delete:** This action enables you to remove a zone when it is no longer needed.

**Utilizing the Search Function:**

The Zone function comes equipped with a convenient **Search** field, allowing you to quickly find specific zones based on their names. To use this feature, simply input the name you wish to search for in the designated search box, and the function will present the matching results.

**Adding a New Zone:**
