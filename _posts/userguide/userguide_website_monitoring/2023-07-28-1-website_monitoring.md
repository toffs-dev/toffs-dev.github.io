This feature allows users to monitor the performance of a Web, Trace Route and Transactions.
Web: This mode test allows checking the availability and performance of a single web page.


Trace Route: This mode test analyzes traffic routing and lets the user see performance and packet loss at each hop from node to test server.


Transactions: This mode test is similar to a Web test in that it emulates the behavior of a browser accessing a website, but it enables to program a series of interactive steps, such as inputting data in a form, accessing a series of pages, etc.
