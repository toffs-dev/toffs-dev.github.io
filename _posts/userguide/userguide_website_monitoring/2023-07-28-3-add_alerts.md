**Alert Logic and Email Sending:**

Based on your configured conditions, the system will count and send email alerts as follows:

- If the website's response time exceeds the Warning or Danger range, the system will send the respective email.
- If the website's availability falls below the Warning or Danger range, the system will send the respective email.
- If the website's response time and availability both meet the Warning or Danger range, the system will send the respective email.
- If the website's values do not meet the Warning or Danger range for either response time or availability, the system will not send any email alerts.

**Note:**
The alert function only works when the monitoring status is ON. If the monitoring status is OFF, the system cannot trigger and send alerts. Make sure the monitoring status is ON to ensure alert functionality
