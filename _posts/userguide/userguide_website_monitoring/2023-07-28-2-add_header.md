You can easily add additional **HTTP headers** or modify existing ones that the agent sends when running a test. Please note that these request settings are only applicable to Web and Transactions test types.

Follow the steps below for each Request Header you wish to add:

**Step 1:** Click the **"+Add Header"** button.

**Step 2:** In the **"Field"** drop-down menu, you have two options:

- Choose from a list of common header field names to configure (see the description of each option below).
- Select "Custom" if you want to define your own header field. If you choose **"Custom"**, remember to input the name of your **Custom** field.

**Step 3 (Optional):** You can provide a **"Host"** value for the header.

**Step 4:** In the **"Value"** input box, enter the data you want to assign to this Header field.

**Step 5:** If you want to add another additional Header, simply click the **"+"** button and repeat Steps 2 to 4.

**Note:**
- When you provide a "Host" for the Field in Header, it means the header will be added for requests that have this specific Host.
- When you do not provide a "Host," it means the header will be added for all requests.
- With DNS Override, the "Host" is required.

By following these steps, you can easily customize the HTTP headers to suit your testing needs using Toffs.
