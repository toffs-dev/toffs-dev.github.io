**Additionally, you can use the following functions to manage nodes:**

- To add new nodes for monitoring, click on the **"+Add"** function.
- If you need to make changes to existing node, utilize the **"Edit"** button to update the region details.
- If you no longer need to monitor a specific region, click on the **"Delete"** button to remove it from the node's monitoring list.
