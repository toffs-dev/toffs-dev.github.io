This is the **“Certificate Information”** page used for **Toffs Technologies Support Team**. Here, you can find all the **SSL Certificate Information** for various domains, including SSL Domain, Create At, Update At, Expired Date, Expire Day, Status, and Type (Upload SSL, Auto SSL).

Let's explore the features of this page:

**Search by Domain:**
You can easily find SSL Certificate Information for a specific domain by entering the domain name in the "Search by Domain" field.

**Status Filter:**
The **"Status"** filter helps you to categorize SSL Certificates based on their current status. Here are the available options:

- **All:** This option displays all the SSL Certificates, regardless of their status.

- **Expired:** When an SSL certificate has expired, its status will appear in Red, and the "Expire Day" will be indicated as N/A in Red as well.

- **Valid:** If an SSL certificate is still valid, its status will appear in Green.

- **7 days**: This option shows SSL certificates that are valid for the next 7 days. The status will be displayed in Green, and the "Expire Day" will appear in Red.

- **30 days:** SSL certificates that are valid for the next 30 days will be displayed here. Their status will be shown in Green, and the "Expire Day" will also appear in Green.

Feel free to utilize these filtering options to quickly find the information you need about SSL certificates.
