This is **“Monitoring Worker”** page, designed exclusively for **Toffs Technologies Support Team.** This page provides valuable insights into the **status** of Multiple CDN records, which are as follows:

- **Active:** When a platform is marked as **"Active"**, it means it is currently in the "Running" status, indicating smooth operation.

- **Wait:** If a platform shows a status of **"Wait"**, it implies that it is in a temporary "Wait" state, indicating that it is waiting to re-activate.

- **Stop:** In case a running platform encounters issues and fails, it switches to an **"All Failed"** status.

Supporters of Toffs Technologies have the authority to manage these CDN records effectively. They can switch the **status of multiple CDN** records **ON** or **OFF**, thereby enabling or halting the operation as needed.



Please contact **Toffs Security Operation Center** for assistance if you encounter any issues.
