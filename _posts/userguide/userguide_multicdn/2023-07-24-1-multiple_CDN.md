This is the **“Multiple CDN”** page used for **Toffs Technologies Support Team**. 

This page serves as a centralized hub for managing records. Our Support Team uses this feature to send records to customers, enabling them to point their domain to the appropriate location.

To begin, let's understand what a multiCDN is. It functions similarly to Sitebacker, but with some key differences. While a Sitebacker pool only allows selecting A types, AAAA types, or CNAME types, a multiCDN can include triple A types, AAAA types, and CNAME types.

To use the multiCDN effectively, you need to ensure that the Host "ruby.testsit.onl.ac" is correctly directed to the MultiCDN using the CName "sxrm34ui_1665111098000.stgmulticdn.onl.ac".

- The **"+Add Record"** function is a powerful tool that allows you to create a new record for a customer and seamlessly send it to them.

- The **"Edit"** button is a handy feature that enables you to modify the information in an existing customer record without any hassle.

- The **"Delete Record"** button is a crucial function that allows you to remove a selected customer record from the database.
 

Please contact **Toffs Security Operation Center** for assistance if you encounter any issues.
