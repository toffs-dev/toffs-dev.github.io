# What is a cloud API?
Cloud APIs are software programs that enable the exchange of data between various cloud computing services or between cloud services and on-premise applications.

These APIs are a subset of application programming interfaces (APIs) that serve as an interface for seamless data transfer between software programs. By utilizing APIs, developers can easily share data and functionalities across different applications without the need to rewrite code or rebuild existing functions.

Cloud APIs can be customized to suit a wide range of purposes. Some common applications include:

1. Resource sharing across multiple cloud providers.
2. Provisioning and management of cloud-hosted infrastructure.
3. Streamlining cloud security processes.
4. Automating disaster recovery procedures.

While cloud APIs establish connections within cloud environments, they may not be universally compatible with every cloud provider or designed to work across different provider environments. Consequently, cloud APIs are often categorized based on the specific cloud vendors they support. A vendor-specific cloud API is designed exclusively for services from a single cloud provider, whereas a cross-platform cloud API is compatible with multiple cloud providers.

# How do cloud APIs work?
A cloud API can be configured in various ways, depending on its intended purpose and the protocol it utilizes.

In general, cloud APIs function by exchanging requests between cloud services or between the cloud and an on-premise application. To facilitate API integrations, each API has specific guidelines that must be adhered to before replicating a function from one API to another.

The process of establishing an API connection is quite intricate, but typically involves the following steps:

1. An API client, such as an application, initiates a request for specific data, commonly referred to as an API call.
2. The API call is received by an API endpoint, which acts as a server.
3. The API endpoint authenticates the request to verify its legitimacy and ensures that it adheres to the correct API protocol (e.g., SOAP, REST, or RPC) and schema.
4. The API endpoint returns the requested data to the API client.

Frequently, cloud API integrations necessitate multiple API calls. To manage this potentially cumbersome process, developers employ API gateways. An API gateway serves as a reverse proxy service that centrally handles API calls. It receives, routes, and delivers API requests and responses. Additionally, API gateways may handle tasks such as rate limiting, authentication, security policy enforcement, and various other functions.

For a more detailed explanation of this process, please refer to the article "What is an API call?"

# What are the main types of cloud APIs?
Cloud APIs are commonly categorized based on the layer at which they establish connections with cloud services. Typically, there are three levels of API integration:

* Infrastructure level: At the infrastructure level, APIs, also known as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) APIs, facilitate the provisioning and management of cloud-hosted infrastructure. These APIs streamline the administration of virtual servers, cloud storage, cloud security, and other software and services related to the infrastructure layer.

* Service level: Service-level APIs, referred to as platform-as-a-service (PaaS) APIs, connect the underlying infrastructure to third-party platforms used for application development. PaaS APIs provide developers with access to development tools, operating systems, software, and databases, empowering them to create their own applications.

* Application level: Application-level APIs, alternatively called software-as-a-service (SaaS) APIs, establish connections between the infrastructure and cloud-based applications managed by third-party providers. SaaS APIs enable users to access fully developed cloud applications (such as Gmail) from a client interface.

To illustrate this concept, imagine Bob wishes to delegate the construction of a house. Bob would engage architects, contractors, electricians, interior decorators, and other professionals, each with distinct roles in building and furnishing the house. Similarly, developers employ different types of APIs when constructing cloud-based applications or integrating applications with cloud services. Just as the team of third-party professionals is crucial for building a house, each API serves as a vital tool for developers to access various functionalities.

# How does Toffs secure cloud APIs?
Just like any other internet-connected system, APIs are susceptible to a range of attacks, including application-layer DDoS attacks and OWASP Top 10 threats. Safeguarding APIs from misuse necessitates a comprehensive defense strategy that can effectively thwart, identify, and mitigate incoming attacks.

With Toffs API Gateway, organizations can efficiently identify and categorize shadow APIs, prevent API data exfiltration, and safeguard APIs from both external and internal threats. To find out more about Toffs API Gateway, please explore it further.
