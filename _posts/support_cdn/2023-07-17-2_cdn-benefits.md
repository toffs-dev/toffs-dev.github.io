#### What are the main CDN benefits?
A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed globally or within a specific region. Their primary purpose is to accelerate content delivery on the internet. CDNs store and cache webpage content such as images, HTML, JavaScript, and video, allowing them to quickly send the cached content to users when they load the webpage. Nowadays, CDNs are an integral part of virtually all websites and applications, ensuring efficient content delivery to users.

CDNs are widely adopted by web applications due to their significant advantages, including improved performance, enhanced reliability, cost savings, and increased resilience against cyber attacks. By leveraging CDNs, web applications can deliver content more efficiently, enhance the overall user experience, reduce costs, and fortify their defenses against online threats.

#### Performance
When people think about CDNs, the first advantage that usually comes to mind is improved speed. And rightfully so. Websites that integrate CDNs have experienced remarkable reductions in load times, with some even witnessing a decrease of 50% or more. CDNs achieve faster content delivery through the following means:

Minimizing the geographical gap between content storage and its intended destination.
Decreasing file sizes to enhance loading speed.
Optimizing server infrastructure to promptly respond to user requests.

#### Reliability
At times, the Internet encounters mishaps. Servers may experience outages, networks can become congested, and connections might be disrupted. In such situations, CDNs play a crucial role in ensuring uninterrupted service for web applications.

CDNs effectively distribute the network traffic load, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed. In the event of a server failure, a CDN can initiate a "failover" process, seamlessly transferring control to a backup server. Remarkably, certain CDNs, like Toffs CDN, possess the ability to navigate around network congestion, similar to GPS navigation systems finding alternative routes to avoid heavy freeway traffic.

Due to their composition of multiple servers distributed across various data centers, CDNs provide extensive redundancy. Even if a server, data center, or an entire region of data centers experiences a disruption, CDNs can still deliver content from other servers within the network.

Cost savings
CDNs help website operators save money by minimizing the need for frequent trips to and from the origin server. By caching a significant portion of a website's content and serving it from the cache, CDNs eliminate the necessity for the origin server to repeatedly deliver the same content. Instead, the CDN takes care of this task on behalf of the origin server.

Website owners are typically charged by web hosting providers based on the amount of data transferred to and from the web host. These charges are often referred to as "bandwidth costs," although "bandwidth" actually pertains to network capacity.

However, when a CDN handles most of a website's content on behalf of the origin server, the amount of data that needs to be transferred significantly decreases. Fewer user requests are directed to the origin server since the CDN handles the majority of them. Consequently, the origin server sends out less content for the same reason, resulting in reduced bandwidth costs.

Resilience against attack
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are highly effective in protecting websites against denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These malicious attacks involve flooding a website with an enormous volume of irrelevant network traffic in an attempt to overpower and bring down the website. CDNs, with their extensive server infrastructure, excel at handling significant traffic loads, including sudden surges caused by DDoS attacks, far better than a lone origin server. By successfully absorbing such traffic, CDNs ensure the continuous online availability of websites, even during relentless attacks.
