# What are indicators of compromise (IoC)?
Indicators of compromise (IoCs) encompass pertinent information regarding a particular security breach, aiding security teams in discerning the occurrence of an attack. This dataset comprises comprehensive insights into the attack, encompassing aspects like the malware variant employed, the associated IP addresses, and various other technical particulars.

# How do indicators of compromise (IoC) work?
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) play a crucial role in enabling organizations to identify and verify the existence of malicious software within their devices or networks. When an attack occurs, it often leaves behind traces of evidence, such as metadata, which security experts can utilize to detect, investigate, and mitigate security incidents effectively.

Organizations can acquire IoCs through various means, including:

- Observation: Vigilantly monitoring systems and devices for any unusual or abnormal activity or behavior.

- Analysis: Assessing the distinct characteristics of suspicious activity and analyzing its potential impact on the security landscape.

- Signatures: Recognizing and pinpointing established patterns and identifiers of known malicious software, allowing for proactive identification and response.

# What are the common types of IoCs?
There are multiple types of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) that can be utilized for detecting security incidents. These encompass:

- Network-based IoCs: These involve identifying malicious IP addresses, domains, or URLs. Additionally, they may encompass analyzing network traffic patterns, detecting unusual port activity, recognizing network connections to known malicious hosts, or identifying data exfiltration patterns.

- Host-based IoCs: These pertain to activities occurring on a workstation or server. Examples of host-based IoCs include analyzing file names or hashes, examining registry keys, or identifying suspicious processes running on the host.

- File-based IoCs: These entail the identification of malicious files such as malware or scripts.

- Behavioral IoCs: This category encompasses various forms of suspicious behavior, including abnormal user actions, irregular login patterns, atypical network traffic behavior, and unusual authentication attempts.

- Metadata IoCs: These are associated with the metadata linked to a file or document, such as the author's information, creation date, or version details.

# Indicators of compromise vs. indicators of attack
IoCs, also known as Indicators of Compromise, share similarities with Indicators of Attack (IoAs), but they possess slight differences. IoAs primarily concentrate on assessing the likelihood of an action or event posing a threat.

To illustrate, an IoA might indicate a high probability of a well-known threat group launching a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against a website. In such a scenario, an IoC could indicate that an unauthorized individual has successfully gained access to the system or network and transferred a substantial amount of data.

Security teams commonly utilize both IoAs and IoCs to identify malicious behavior by attackers. As another example, an IoC might identify an unusually high volume of network traffic, while the IoA serves as a prediction that this heightened network traffic could indicate an upcoming DDoS attack. These indicators collectively provide significant insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities within networks and systems.

# Indicators of compromise best practices
The best practices for indicators of compromise (IoC) encompass a range of strategies. These include employing a combination of automated and manual tools to effectively monitor, detect, and analyze signs of cyber attacks.

Given the continuous evolution of technologies and attack methods, it is of utmost significance to consistently revise and enhance IoC protocols. By keeping abreast of IoC procedures and adhering to the latest best practices, organizations can proactively anticipate the changing threat landscape and safeguard themselves against malicious activities.
