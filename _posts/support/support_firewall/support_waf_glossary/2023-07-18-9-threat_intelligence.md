# What is threat intelligence in cyber security?
Threat intelligence refers to valuable information regarding potential attacks that an organization may encounter, along with techniques to identify and thwart such attacks. Similar to law enforcement's distribution of "Wanted" posters containing suspect details, cyber threat intelligence provides insights into the nature and origins of existing threats.

Within the realm of digital security, a "threat" denotes any malicious action that aims to compromise or manipulate data without authorization, encompassing both potential and actual attacks. Threat intelligence goes beyond mere data provision by empowering organizations to proactively respond to these threats. Each piece of threat intelligence contributes to the detection and prevention of attacks.

Various forms of threat intelligence can be utilized to enhance the effectiveness of firewalls, web application firewalls (WAFs), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and other security products, enabling them to better recognize and block threats. Additionally, more comprehensive types of threat intelligence offer broader insights, aiding organizations in making strategic decisions.

# What are the three main types of threat intelligence?
Threat intelligence can be categorized into three main types:

* Strategic Intelligence: This type of intelligence focuses on overarching trends and long-term issues. It encompasses the motivations, goals, and methods employed by known attackers.

* Operational Intelligence: Operational intelligence delves into the specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) utilized by attackers. It involves identifying which malware toolkits or exploit kits attackers employ, pinpointing the origin of their attacks, and understanding the sequential steps they typically follow to execute an attack.

* Tactical Intelligence: Tactical intelligence provides detailed on-the-ground information about threats, allowing organizations to identify and address specific threats on a case-by-case basis. It involves the use of malware signatures and indicators of compromise (IoC) to gain insights into potential attacks. Further explanations of these terms are provided below.

# What is a malware signature?
A signature refers to a distinct arrangement or series of bytes that serves as a means to recognize malware. Just as fingerprints aid in identifying individuals suspected of engaging in illegal activities, signatures play a crucial role in identifying harmful software.

Signature detection stands as one of the prevalent techniques employed in malware analysis. To ensure its efficacy, signature detection must be consistently refreshed with the most recent malware signatures discovered in the wild.

# What are indicators of compromise (IoC)?
An indicator of compromise (IoC) serves as a vital clue in determining the occurrence or ongoing progress of an attack. Think of an IoC as a tangible piece of evidence that a skilled detective would collect to ascertain the presence of certain individuals at the scene of a crime. Similarly, specific digital evidence such as abnormal activity recorded in logs or unauthorized network traffic to servers can assist administrators in recognizing the existence and nature of an attack, whether it has already transpired or is currently unfolding.

The absence of IoCs can pose challenges when attempting to confirm the incidence of an attack. Attackers often benefit from remaining undetected, particularly when their objective involves utilizing compromised devices within a botnet.

# What is a threat intelligence feed?
A threat intelligence feed refers to an external flow of data containing valuable threat intelligence. Similar to an RSS feed for blogs, organizations can opt to subscribe to a threat intelligence feed to receive regular security updates for their systems.

These feeds can be categorized into two types: free feeds and premium feeds. While free feeds offer publicly available information, premium feeds come at a cost and provide exclusive intelligence that is not accessible through open sources.
